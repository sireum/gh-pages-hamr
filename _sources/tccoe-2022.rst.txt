Overview
=================

This page presents the artifacts used in the TCCOE tutorial 

* tutorial slides and videos
* virtual machine file (.ova) that provides a virtual machine for the tools and example files used in the tutorial

*Note: most of these artifacts are hosted on Google Drive.  We have observed that these Google-hosted videos sometimes fail to launch in certain web browers. If this happens for you, we suggest that you use the Google Chrome browser, as we have found it to be the most reliable for launching these Google-hosted videos.*

Virtual Machine Setup and Tutorial Artifacts
=============================================

The instructions for downloading and setting up the VM for the tutorial can be found `here <https://github.com/santoslab/tccoe22-hamr>`__ .

An OVA (Open Virtual Appliance) has been created that has all the development tools that will be used in this tutorial preinstalled. You will need a virtualization provider that is capable of importing the OVA such as VMWare or VirtualBox. We recommend using VirtualBox as it is free/open-source and can be downloaded via https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

All the tools and examples needed for the tutorial are included in the VM.

Other Lecture Videos and Supporting Material
============================================

The `High Assurance Systems <http://s21.highassurance.santoslab.org/lectures.html>`__ graduate course at Kansas State University provides in-depth lectures on AADL modeling (including the lectures/exercises suggested for learning AADL) and HAMR development using Slang.
